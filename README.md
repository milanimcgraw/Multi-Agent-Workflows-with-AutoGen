# Multi-Agent Workflows with AutoGen
## ⚙️ Project Overview

This repository showcases a collection of multi-agent system demos built using the [AutoGen](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen) framework and [OpenAI's GPT-4o](https://openai.com/index/gpt-4o). Each notebook demonstrates a distinct **agentic design pattern** tailored to real-world use cases such as financial analysis, code generation, customer onboarding, creative writing, collaborative dialogue, and tool-augmented reasoning.

## ⚙️ AutoGen

[AutoGen](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen) is Microsoft’s open-source framework for building multi-agent AI systems that can act autonomously or collaborate with humans. Designed with layered abstraction, AutoGen enables structured conversations, tool usage, and cross-agent coordination with ease.

Leverage its flexible Core API for event-driven message passing, or rapidly prototype using the higher-level AgentChat API. Extend functionality with integrations for code execution, OpenAI models, and other LLM providers.

> For examples, tools, and community-driven innovation, explore the [AutoGen GitHub repo](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen), [AutoGen Bench](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen#autogen-bench), or contribute via [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/discussions).

## ⚙️ Agent Workflows

### 🤖 Startup Pitch Simulation
A two-agent chat that simulates a conversation between a startup founder and an investor, using `ConversableAgent`. This showcases AutoGen’s ability to construct realistic business dialogues through structured multi-agent conversations.

### 💻 Coding & Financial Analysis: Stock Plotting 
An autonomous agent that generates Python code to retrieve and visualize stock data and create a performance plot. Includes the integration of custom user-defined functions. Agents automatically save generated `.py` and `.png` files. All files are featured in the "Outputs" folder of this repo. 

### 📊 Financial Analysis Report Generator
A multi-agent group chat that creates a comprehensive stock performance report. Includes planning, data retrieval, interpretation, and collaborative writing agents. Includes user-in-the-loop feedback and a supporting script for external API calls (`fetch_nvidia_news.py`).

### 🧾 Customer Onboarding
A sequential multi-agent pipeline simulating customer onboarding using `ConversableAgent` and `initiate_chats`. A sequence of chats between agents to provide a guided customer onboarding experience for a product, using the multi-agent collaboration pattern.

### 📝 Blog Post Creation with Reflection
A high-quality blog post is generated by a `Writer` agent, then reviewed by nested agents inside a `Critic`. This design reflects on the content using SEO, ethics, and legal perspectives through recursive multi-agent feedback.

### ♟️ Conversational Chess
A tool-using game where two agents play chess, using the `python-chess` library. Agents legally move pieces, call functions, and reason about the board state in turn-based fashion.

## ⚙️ Getting Started
**To run the multi-agent demos in this repository:**

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Multi-Agent-Workflows-with-AutoGen.git
cd Multi-Agent-Workflows-with-AutoGen
``` 
### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
**or**
```bash
pip install notebook==7.1.2 autogen autogen-agentchat>=0.4 autogen-ext[openai]>=0.4 chess==1.10.0 matplotlib numpy pandas yfinance openai ipywidgets
```
### 3. Set Your OpenAI API Key
**To use GPT-4o or any OpenAI LLM, export your API key as an environment variable:**
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
```
**or set it within your notebook using:**

```python
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv, find_dotenv

# these expect to find a .env file at the directory above the lesson.                                                                                                                     # the format for that file is (without the comment)                                                                                                                                       #API_KEYNAME=AStringThatIsTheLongAPIKeyFromSomeService                                                                                                                                     
def load_env():
    _ = load_dotenv(find_dotenv())

def get_openai_api_key():
    load_env()
    openai_api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
    return openai_api_key
```
### 4. Launch Jupyter Notebook
**Start the notebook environment to explore the agent workflows:**
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
**Then open any notebook from the list in the ⚙️ Notebooks section.**
