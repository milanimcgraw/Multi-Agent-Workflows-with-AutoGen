    "- **Task planning**\n",
    "- **Data retrieval**\n",
    "- **Code execution**\n",
    "- **Report writing**\n",

    "A separate script (`fetch_nvidia_news.py`) also enables external news sourcing via the **NewsAPI**.\n",

    "By structuring the system with **reusable components** and **feedback-aware behavior**, this project demonstrates how **autonomous agents** can handle complex financial analysis workflows with **minimal manual intervention**."

      "### Step 1: Fetch Nvidia's Stock Data\n",
      "1. **Objective**: Retrieve Nvidia's historical stock prices from 2025-05-23 to 2025-06-23.\n",
      "2. **Method**: Use the `yfinance` library in Python to download the stock data.\n",
      "   - Code:\n",
      "     ```python\n",
      "     import yfinance as yf\n",
      "\n",
      "     # Fetch historical data for Nvidia (NVDA)\n",
      "     nvda = yf.Ticker(\"NVDA\")\n",

      "     ```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 2: Analyze Stock Metrics\n",
      "1. **Objective**: Calculate the highest, lowest, and closing prices during the specified period, and determine the stock's volatility.\n",
      "2. **Method**: Use Pandas to perform the analysis on the fetched data.\n",
      "   - Code:\n",
      "     ```python\n",
      "     import pandas as pd\n",
      "\n",
      "     # Calculate highest, lowest, and closing prices\n",
      "     highest_price = stock_data['High'].max()\n",
      "     lowest_price = stock_data['Low'].min()\n",
      "     closing_price = stock_data['Close'].iloc[-1]\n",
      "\n",
      "     # Calculate volatility as the standard deviation of the daily close prices\n",
      "     volatility = stock_data['Close'].std()\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 3: Find Significant News or Events\n",
      "1. **Objective**: Identify news articles or events that could have influenced Nvidia's stock prices.\n",
      "2. **Method**: Use the NewsAPI to fetch news articles related to Nvidia within the date range.\n",
      "   - **Note**: If NewsAPI cannot be accessed or requires payment, search for publicly available financial news articles online.\n",
      "   - Code:\n",
      "     ```python\n",
      "     from newsapi import NewsApiClient\n",
      "\n",
      "     newsapi = NewsApiClient(api_key='YOUR_NEWSAPI_KEY')\n",

      "     ```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 4: Draft the Blog Post in Markdown Format\n",
      "1. **Objective**: Consolidate the findings into a readable, engaging blog post using markdown.\n",
      "2. **Method**: Formulate the markdown content using the extracted data and analysis.\n",
      "   - Content Example:\n",
      "     ```markdown\n",
      "     # Analyzing Nvidia's Stock Performance: May 23, 2025 - June 23, 2025\n",
